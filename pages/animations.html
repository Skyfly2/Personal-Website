        <h3 style="margin-left: 0%">Ra, The Mighty Egyptian God</h3><p style="margin-left: 0%"><b>Ra, The Mighty Egyptian God</b> was a 3D animation produced around the idea of the bed. The bed is an important invention of the ancient Egyptians. One of the most powerful Gods in Egyptian mythology is Ra, the half-human half-bird god of the sun. This animation sets the story of a very young version of Ra who has not yet developed any of his physical human features. Ra is awoken by a few strikes of lightning while asleep in his tree, however, he remains very tired. The narrator prods Ra to begin his godly duties for the day, but all Ra attempts to do is build a place to sleep. After numerous incidents occur, each destroying his "sleeping contraption", eventually Ra invents the bed and falls asleep in it to the dismay of the narrator. This animation was a collaboration with three other people, produced for the 3D Animation event at the 2019 <a href="https:www.patsa.org">Pennsylvania Technology Student Association</a> State competition where it placed 2nd.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 0%">The Rube Goldberg Machine</h3><p style="margin-left: 0%"><b>The Rube Goldberg Machine</b> was a 3D animation produced with three other people as part of a 24 hour animation challenge with the theme of a "living wall". As soon as we received the prompt, we instantly decided that a rube goldberg machine would do the trick. Using many of the 3D models that we had already created, we themed the rube goldberg machine to different inventions throughout history. The animation goes through a run of the machine, showing off trebuchets, shields, helmets, barrels, a telegraph, nukes, rockets, and even more, going from an ancient greek level of technology all the way to creative technologies that may occur in the future. At the very end of the animation, the camera pans out to show the viewer the museum of invention, within which the machine exists.</p>
