        <h3 style="margin-left: 0%">TSABox</h3><p style="margin-left: 0%">TSABox is a comprehensive web based suite of tools designed for the management of chapters within the Technology Student Association (TSA), an organization designed to develop leadership and technology skills through S.T.E.M competitions. TSABox was a collaborative effort between myself and four other people as an entry in the Software Development event for the 2019 national TSA competition. TSABox ended up placing 3rd in this competition. The purpose of designing TSABox was that there was no streamlined piece of software for chapter management, making simple logistics such as event registration quite a hassle for the advisor and officer team of each chapter. In 2018, the Chaptersweet project was developed by one of the team members to alleviate some of these issues, however there were fundamental and structural improvements that we wanted to see in software. TSABox was built from the ground up to provide structure to every TSA chapter. Its core features can be broken into three distinct categories: the officerbox, eventsbox, and socialbox. The officerbox provides tools for chapter officers to more effectively lead their chapters and develop a yearly plan of work. The eventsbox provides the framework for efficient event registration within the chapter, a kanban board for team cooperation, metrics for task progress and completion, as well as the social profiles of the user's teammates. The socialbox provides the abilities for users to interact with other users from both within and outside of their respective chapter. TSABox was built on a WAMP stack. The team wrote custom PHP to be run on the Apache server that TSABox utilizes. Custom SQL was used for database queries. The client-side was written in custom html, CSS, and JavaScript and the Bootstrap library was used for design.</p>
